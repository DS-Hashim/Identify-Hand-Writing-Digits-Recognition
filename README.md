#Handwriting Digit Recognition Project
##Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits. The model will be trained on the MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels. The goal of this project is to build a model that can achieve high accuracy on the MNIST test set.
##Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed:
Python 3
NumPy
TensorFlow
Matplotlib
Usage
To train the model, run the following command:
Copy code
python train.py 
This will train the model on the MNIST dataset and save the weights to a file.
To evaluate the model on the test set, run the following command:
Copy code
python test.py 
This will load the weights from the file and evaluate the model on the MNIST test set. The accuracy of the model will be printed to the console.
To make predictions on new images, run the following command:
phpCopy code
python predict.py <path_to_image> 
This will load the weights from the file and make a prediction on the image located at path_to_image. The prediction will be printed to the console.
##Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of deep learning to recognize handwritten digits. The model achieved high accuracy on the MNIST test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in image recognition tasks. With further fine-tuning and more training data, this model could be used in real-world applications, such as recognizing handwritten digits on checks or forms.
